# jekyll-build-pages

A simple GitHub Action for producing Jekyll build artifacts compatible with GitHub Pages.

## Scope

This is used along with [`actions/deploy-pages`](https://github.com/actions/deploy-pages) as part of the official support for building Pages with Actions (currently in public beta for public repositories).

## Usage

A basic Pages deployment workflow with the `jekyll-build-pages` action looks like this.

```yaml
name: Build Jekyll site
on:
 push:
   branches: ["main"]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
      - name: Build
        uses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
```

To write to a different destination directory, match the inputs of both the `jekyll-build-pages` and [`upload-pages-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact) actions.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Build
    uses: actions/jekyll-build-pages@v1
    with:
      destination: "./output"
  - name: Upload artifact
    uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
    with:
      path: "./output"
```

### Action inputs

| Input | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `source` | `./` | The directory to build from |
| `destination` | `./_site` | The directory to write output into<br>(this should match the `path` input of the [`actions/upload-pages-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-pages-artifact) action) |
| `future` | `false` | If `true`, writes content dated in the future |
| `build_revision` | `$GITHUB_SHA` | The SHA-1 of the Git commit for which the build is running |
| `verbose` | `false` | If `true`, prints verbose output in logs |
| `token` | `$GITHUB_TOKEN` | The GitHub token used to authenticate API requests |

## Release instructions

In order to release a new version of this Action:

1. Locate the semantic version of the [upcoming release][release-list] (a draft is maintained by the [`draft-release` workflow][draft-release]).

2. Prepare a pull request to update [`action.yml`][action.yml] to reference the incoming version, get it approved, and merge it into the `main` branch.

3. Publish the draft release **as a pre-release** from the `main` branch with semantic version as the tag name, _with_:
   - the checkbox to publish to the GitHub Marketplace checked :ballot_box_with_check:
   - :warning: _AND_ the checkbox to **Set as a pre-release** checked. :ballot_box_with_check:

4. This will kick off a [Docker publishing workflow][docker-publish] for the newly created tag. Check the [associated workflow run list][docker-publish-workflow-runs] to verify the new Docker image is created successfully before moving on to the next step.

5. After the Docker image has been created with the new tag, find that [same pre-release][release-list] and edit it. Update it with the checkbox to **Set as the latest release** checked :ballot_box_with_check: and then publish it again.

6. After publishing it as the latest release, the [`release` workflow][release] will automatically run to create/update the corresponding the major version tag such as `v1`.

   ⚠️ Environment approval is required. Check the [Release workflow run list][release-workflow-runs].
